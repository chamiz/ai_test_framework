        "expected_output" : "\"\"\nIn the heart of the Andes, a curious llama named Lola gazed up at the sky and noticed an unusual cloud with a vibrant orange color. Captivated by this strange sight, Lola decided to embark on a journey to find the source of the orange cloud.\n\nLola lived on a farm with her companion, an old alpaca named Alberto. Together, they had explored the nearby mountains, but this cloud was unlike anything they had ever seen. Alberto, sensing Lola's excitement, agreed to join her in the adventure.\n\nTheir journey took them through rocky paths and flowing streams, and along the way, they encountered various creatures. A group of playful monkeys cheered them on, while a wise condor offered them advice: \"Trust in your curiosity, for the orange cloud reveals itself to those who seek it.\"\n\nAs the sun set, Lola and Alberto arrived at the edge of a valley where they could finally see the orange cloud glowing like a jewel in the sky. \n\nThe two companions approached the cloud, which was no longer just an optical illusion but seemed to hum with a gentle energy. As they reached it, the cloud began to take shape into a mythical dragon that circled around them. The dragon spoke in a deep voice, \"Welcome, brave souls. Your journey shows your wonder and courage. I grant you one wish each.\"\n\nLola and Alberto, sharing a glance, spoke together, \"We wish to share our love of adventure, so others may also discover the magic we have found.\"\n\"\"\"\n"
